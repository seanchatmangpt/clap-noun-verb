# Claude Code Commands

This directory contains slash commands for Claude Code that implement comprehensive development workflows based on Lean Six Sigma, Design for Lean Six Sigma (DfLSS), and expert engineering practices, adapted for the clap-noun-verb CLI framework project.

**Use when**: Prioritizing work, identifying critical gaps, maximizing value delivery

#### `/expert-testing-patterns`
Expert testing patterns - Comprehensive testing strategies including AAA pattern, real collaborators, behavior verification.

**Use when**: Writing tests, improving test quality, test-driven development

#### `/verify-tests`
Systematic test verification - Ensure tests are correct, complete, and valuable. Validate test quality.

**Use when**: Reviewing tests, ensuring test coverage, validating test effectiveness

### Process Control

#### `/andon-signals`
Visual management - Recognize and respond to problem signals. Stop and fix issues immediately.

**Use when**: Monitoring build/test failures, detecting quality issues, rapid response

#### `/gemba-walk`
Go to the source - Observe actual code and systems where work happens. Understand reality vs. assumptions.

**Use when**: Understanding systems, investigating issues, learning codebase

### Release Management

#### `/release-preparation`
Comprehensive release readiness checklist - Ensure code is ready for production deployment.

**Use when**: Preparing for releases, pre-deployment verification, quality gates

### Git Workflow

#### `/acp`
Add, Commit, Push workflow - Complete git workflow with validation checkpoints. Ensures code quality before committing.

**Use when**: Staging changes, committing code, pushing to remote

**Comprehensive (30+ minutes)**: `/dmaic-problem-solving`, `/root-cause-analysis`, `/fmea`, `/robust-design`

## Methodology Alignment

These commands implement **Design for Lean Six Sigma (DfLSS)** methodology, which integrates:

- **Lean** (efficiency, waste elimination)
- **Six Sigma** (quality, defect prevention)
- **Expert Engineering Practices** (type safety, testing, patterns)

### Key Principles

1. **Continuous Improvement** - Small improvements compound over time
2. **Root Cause Focus** - Fix underlying causes, not symptoms
3. **Type-Level Prevention** - Make errors impossible through design
4. **Data-Driven** - Use measurements and verification
5. **Customer Focus** - Deliver value to users

## Integration Patterns

Commands are designed to work together:

- **Problem → Analysis → Solution**: `/andon-signals` → `/root-cause-analysis` → `/kaizen-improvement`
- **New Feature**: `/voice-of-customer-qfd` → `/poka-yoke-design` → `/expert-testing-patterns`
- **Quality Improvement**: `/verify-tests` → `/root-cause-analysis` → `/poka-yoke-design`
- **Code Quality**: `/gemba-walk` → `/eliminate-muda` → `/eliminate-mura`
- **Git Workflow**: `/acp` → `/verify-tests` → `/release-preparation`

## Usage Tips

1. **Start Small**: Use `/80-20-fill-gaps` to identify highest-value work
2. **Fix Problems**: Use `/root-cause-analysis` for debugging
3. **Improve Continuously**: Use `/kaizen-improvement` for incremental improvements
4. **Prevent Errors**: Use `/poka-yoke-design` for type safety
5. **New Designs**: Use `/poka-yoke-design` for new features
6. **Git Workflow**: Use `/acp` for all git operations

## Build System

**CRITICAL**: All commands use `cargo make` instead of direct `cargo` commands. This ensures:
- Consistent build behavior
- Proper handling of proc-macro crates
- Timeout protection
- Workspace-aware operations

**Examples**:
- `cargo make test` (not `cargo test`)
- `cargo make check` (not `cargo check`)
- `cargo make lint` (not `cargo clippy`)

## Test Performance

**CRITICAL**: The entire test suite must complete in <1 second. All test commands include timeout protection:
- `timeout 1s cargo make test` - Full test suite
- Individual tests should be fast (<100ms each) to allow parallel execution

## Command Format

Each command follows a consistent format:

1. **Purpose** - What the command does and why
2. **Workflow Overview** - High-level steps
3. **Step-by-Step Instructions** - Detailed guidance
4. **Examples** - Concrete implementations
5. **Best Practices** - Expert insights
6. **Integration** - How it connects to other commands

## Contributing

When adding new commands:

1. Follow existing command structure
2. Include concrete examples
3. Integrate with existing commands
4. Document methodology alignment
5. Add to this README
6. Use `cargo make` commands consistently
7. Include timeout protection for long-running operations
