# Phase 3: Optimization Tests

Test suite for Phase 3 optimization features:
- `frontier-intelligence` - Learning trajectories + agent2028 + observability
- Adaptive learning mechanisms
- Performance optimization
- Intelligent agent coordination

## Performance Benchmarks

All tests must verify:
- Performance SLOs met
- Memory usage within bounds
- Latency targets achieved
- Throughput requirements satisfied
