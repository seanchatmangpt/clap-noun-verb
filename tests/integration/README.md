# Integration Tests

Cross-phase integration tests:
- Feature interaction tests
- End-to-end workflows
- System integration validation
- Real-world usage scenarios

## Test Strategy

1. **Feature Compatibility** - Verify features work together
2. **Performance Integration** - Ensure no degradation with multiple features
3. **Security Integration** - Validate security across feature boundaries
4. **Observability Integration** - Comprehensive telemetry coverage
