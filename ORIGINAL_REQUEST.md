# Original User Request

## Initial Request — 2026-05-28T18:21:05Z

Research the `clap-noun-verb` codebase and construct a shared `utils` package containing common tools required for working in different contexts (like completions, mangen, adapters, help, markdown, display_json, etc.).

Working directory: /Users/sac/clap-noun-verb

## Requirements

### R1. Codebase Research & Needs Analysis
Analyze the existing `clap-noun-verb` crate structure, dependencies, and execution contexts (e.g., CLI parsing, completions, adapters, markdown/manpage generation). Identify common code patterns, helper functions, or missing utilities.

### R2. Core Utils Crate/Module
Design and implement a highly cohesive utility library (`utils`) or module that provides clean abstractions/helpers around the specified clap ecosystem crates (`clap_complete`, `clap-num`, `clap_mangen`, `clap-markdown`, `display_json`, `clap-adapters`, `clap-help`).

### R3. Comprehensive Integration Tests & Verification
Provide an automated integration test suite that exercises the utility library across all target capabilities (e.g., verifying complete generation, adapter mappings, JSON display formatting) to guarantee correctness and prevent regression.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Utility Verification
- [ ] The shared utility library builds successfully with zero compiler errors under the current Rust toolchain.
- [ ] Integration tests verify correctness for completions, formatting, help formatting, or adapter conversions.
- [ ] No placeholder implementations or TODOs in the final codebase.

## Follow-up — 2026-05-28T18:57:43Z

Integrate the newly created shared `utils` (`clap-noun-verb-utils`) package across the workspace examples, the standalone playground packages, and associated commands to replace manual/ad-hoc boilerplate helpers with centralized, robust utility implementations (e.g. for completions, adapters, markdown generation, help output, and number parsing).

Working directory: /Users/sac/clap-noun-verb

## Requirements

### R1. Examples Integration
Refactor the guides and reference implementations under `examples/` to consume functions and traits from the new `utils` crate rather than maintaining local stubs or mocks.

### R2. Playground Integration
Update command modules and serialization configurations inside `playground/` to leverage common structures from the `utils` library (such as `completions`, `display_json`, `adapters`, and `number_parsing`).

### R3. Workspace-wide Compilation and Tests
Verify that all refactored examples, the updated playground targets, and all unit/integration tests compile cleanly and execute successfully without regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Integration Verification
- [ ] Refactored examples build successfully (`cargo build --examples`) using the shared `utils` dependency.
- [ ] Standalone playground targets compile cleanly and pass their respective test suites.
- [ ] No local boilerplate redundancies remain for tools supported by the `utils` library.
