## Q&A Preparation

### Likely Questions:
1. **On Architecture**: "How did you decompose the system into three tiers?"
   - Answer: CLI/Integration/Domain separation enables testing and reusability
   - Mention: Builder, Registry, Router, Factory, Middleware patterns

2. **On Type Safety**: "What compile-time guarantees do you achieve?"
   - Answer: Phantom types for state machines, const generics for validation
   - Mention: Zero-cost abstractions (0 bytes overhead for phantom types)

3. **On Testing**: "How do you achieve 100% Chicago TDD adoption?"
   - Answer: 1,587 AAA pattern instances across 967+ test functions
   - Mention: State-based testing with real collaborators, not mocks

4. **On Performance**: "Why is compilation 67% faster?"
   - Answer: Incremental compilation strategy and minimal allocations
   - Mention: 78% smaller binaries vs targets

5. **On Production Readiness**: "What's blocking full deployment?"
   - Answer: 2 minor issues - missing binary infrastructure and formatting
   - Mention: Core framework is 99% ready, minor fixes clear blockers

### Defense Strategy:
- Lead with comprehensive research coverage (94% is strong)
- Emphasize empirical evidence (967+ tests)
- Show architectural decisions are principled (5 design patterns)
- Acknowledge limitations but show they're addressable
- Connect technical insights to strategic value (trillion-agent ecosystem potential)
