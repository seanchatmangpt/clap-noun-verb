## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Revenue Diversification Reduces Risk
Instead of depending on one stream, build 7 complementary revenue sources:
- Support + Training = $162K (foundation)
- ggen SaaS = $136K (platform revenue)
- Consulting = $50K (services revenue)
- Others = $80K (emerging streams)

### 2. Launch Order Matters
Start with low-effort streams (support, training) to generate cash, then use that cash to fund complex streams (ggen, enterprise).

```
Month 1-3:  Support + Training + Consulting
            ↓
            Cash flow ($8.5K/mo)
            ↓
Month 4-8:  + ggen SaaS + Marketplace
Month 9-12: + Enterprise Features
            ↓
Result:     $100K/mo by Year 1 end
```

### 3. Different Customers, Different Streams
- Individual developers → Training ($49), Marketplace ($9-99)
- Small teams → Support ($99), Training, Consulting
- Mid-market → Support ($499), ggen SaaS, Frontier Pro
- Enterprise → Support ($1,999), Consulting, Enterprise Features

### 4. Customer Acquisition Cost Varies
- Support & Training: Low CAC (~$100-200), high LTV
- Consulting: Higher CAC ($5K-10K), very high LTV
- ggen SaaS: Medium CAC (~$500), medium LTV
- Marketplace: Organic, creator-driven, low CAC
