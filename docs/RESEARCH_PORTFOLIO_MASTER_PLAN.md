## Shared Artifacts & Synergies

### Shared Foundation: 360 Templates
All 4 papers leverage the same artifact set:
- 60 domain nouns (user, product, database, deployment, etc.)
- 6 verb operations (create, read, update, delete, list, execute)
- 360 base templates with patterns already extracted

### Cross-Paper References
- Paper 1 establishes pattern foundation
- Paper 2 deepens error handling patterns from Paper 1
- Paper 3 uses semantic understanding from patterns
- Paper 4 formalizes composition mechanisms from patterns

**Synergy Effect**: Together, papers create unified research narrative about systematic CLI design

### Shared Evaluation Data
- Baseline implementations can be reused
- Some experiments overlap (timing, code metrics)
- User study participants can provide feedback across papers
- All use same 360 template corpus

**Efficiency Gain**: ~20% reduction in total work through data sharing
