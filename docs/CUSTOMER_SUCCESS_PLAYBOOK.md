# Customer Success Playbook

**Onboarding, retention, and expansion strategy for 7 revenue streams**

---

## Executive Summary

**Why CS Matters**: 50% of revenue comes from retention, not acquisition.

- **Churn Cost**: Lose 1 customer = lose 12 months of revenue
- **Expansion Opportunity**: Existing customer 5x easier to upsell than new customer
- **Retention Rule**: Every 5% reduction in churn = 25-40% increase in LTV

**This Playbook Covers**:
1. Day 1-7 onboarding for each stream
2. 30/60/90-day check-ins
3. Expansion triggers (upsell opportunities)
4. Churn prevention playbook
5. Customer success metrics dashboard

## Part 6: Churn Prevention Playbook

### Churn Warning Signs (Action Triggers)

```
RED FLAG 1: No Usage (Churn Risk: 80%)
├─ Trigger: 7+ days with no activity
├─ Root Cause Possibilities:
│  ├─ They forgot (most common)
│  ├─ They're confused (onboarding failed)
│  ├─ Wrong product fit (shouldn't have bought)
│  └─ They're busy (temporary, will return)
└─ Intervention:
   - Day 7: "We miss you!" email with quick win
   - Day 14: Personal check-in call (show care)
   - Day 21: Offer to schedule walk-through
   - Day 30: Consider refund if still inactive

RED FLAG 2: Feature Misunderstanding (Churn Risk: 60%)
├─ Trigger: Customer says "I didn't know you could do [X]"
├─ Root Cause: Onboarding missed feature
└─ Intervention:
   - Immediate: Send feature walkthrough video
   - Follow-up: Schedule call to explore use cases
   - Long-term: Update onboarding for others

RED FLAG 3: Expectation Mismatch (Churn Risk: 70%)
├─ Trigger: Customer says "This doesn't do [X]"
├─ Root Cause: Wrong product fit or unclear expectations
└─ Intervention:
   - Call immediately (don't email)
   - Listen: What did they expect vs. reality?
   - Explore: Might different stream help more?
   - Offer: Downgrade, refund, or pivot to different product

RED FLAG 4: Usage Drop (Churn Risk: 50%)
├─ Trigger: Usage 30% below baseline for 2 weeks
├─ Root Cause Possibilities:
│  ├─ Unrelated problem at their company
│  ├─ Competitive product they're testing
│  ├─ Your product had issue (bug, poor support response)
│  └─ They completed their goal (natural churn)
└─ Intervention:
   - Check-in: "Haven't heard from you - everything okay?"
   - If problem: Fix it + offer discount extension
   - If competitive: Offer trial of additional feature
   - If complete: Celebrate + discuss future needs

RED FLAG 5: Support Complaint (Churn Risk: 40% if unresolved)
├─ Trigger: Customer complains about support, quality, or pricing
├─ Root Cause: Unmet expectation + poor response
└─ Intervention:
   - Respond in 30 min (not 24h, not 4h)
   - Take ownership (don't pass to someone else)
   - Over-deliver on solution (show you care)
   - Follow-up: "Did that solve it? Anything else I can help?"
   - If still unhappy: Offer upgrade discount or partial refund

RED FLAG 6: Budget Constraints Mentioned (Churn Risk: 60%)
├─ Trigger: "We might need to cut costs" or "Can we downgrade?"
├─ Root Cause: Budget pressure, not dissatisfaction
└─ Intervention:
   - Offer: "Let's explore options that fit your budget"
   - Options:
     1. Downgrade to lower tier (keep them paying)
     2. Annual prepay (give 20% discount, ensure stability)
     3. Expand features (show ROI, prove value)
   - Never let them leave if they still see value
```

### Churn Recovery Script (If Customer Says They Want to Leave)

```
WHEN YOU HEAR "We want to cancel":

STEP 1: DON'T PANIC - Thank them
"Thank you for letting me know. I want to understand what happened."

STEP 2: ASK - Uncover root cause
"Help me understand - what's driving this decision?"
Listen. Don't interrupt. Ask follow-up questions.

STEP 3: VALIDATE - Show you understand
"I hear you - [rephrasing their concern]. That makes sense."

STEP 4: EXPLORE - Are there alternatives?
"Before we cancel, can I ask - would [Alternative] work?
   - Lower tier price?
   - Different product fit?
   - Extended trial of [Feature]?
   - Different contract term?

STEP 5: FINAL OFFER - Show you value them
"I really think we can solve this. Here's what I can offer:
   - [Discount to lower tier]
   - [Additional feature free for 3 months]
   - [Extended support / extra help]"

STEP 6: DECISION - Respect their choice
If they still want to leave:
"I understand. I'll process the cancellation.
 Two asks:
 1. Can I ask what you'll use instead? (Learning)
 2. Would you be open to reconnecting in 6 months? (Future)

 Thank you for trying us. We hope to work together again."

STEP 7: FOLLOW-UP - Exit interview
After cancellation, send email:
"We miss you! To help others avoid similar issues, would you
spend 5 min on this quick survey?"
→ Survey about what didn't work
→ What would bring you back?
→ Any feedback on our support?

STEP 8: TRACK - Learn from it
Log in churn database:
- Customer: [Name]
- Reason: [Primary reason for churn]
- Prevention: [What could have prevented this?]
- Reactivation: [Could we win them back?]

## Remember: The CS Leverage

**Every 5% of churn reduction = 25% increase in revenue**

Why? Because:
- Acquiring customer = $500 CAC
- Retaining customer = $50 effort
- Cost difference = 10x

A 5% churn reduction on 100 customers = 5 customers saved
- Acquisition: 5 × $500 = $2,500 cost
- Retention: 5 × $50 = $250 cost
- Savings: $2,250

And that's just Year 1. Over customer LTV:
- Lost customer LTV: $5,000
- Saved customer LTV: $5,000
- Total impact: 5 × $5,000 = $25,000

**CS isn't a cost center - it's a revenue multiplier.**
