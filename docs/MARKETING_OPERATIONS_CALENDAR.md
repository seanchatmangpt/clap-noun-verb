## Part 1: Content Marketing Strategy

### 80/20 Content Plan

```
WHAT WORKS FOR DEVELOPER TOOLS:

80% of leads come from:
├─ Search (Google)
├─ Community (Reddit, HackerNews)
├─ Twitter
├─ YouTube
└─ Word of mouth

80% of effort should go to:
├─ 1 blog post/week (SEO)
├─ 3 tweets/week (community)
├─ 1 tutorial video/week (YouTube)
├─ 1 case study/month (social proof)

NOT EFFECTIVE (Skip these):
├─ Facebook ads (wrong audience)
├─ Instagram (not where devs hang)
├─ Email blasts (low open rate)
├─ Sponsorships (usually waste)
```
