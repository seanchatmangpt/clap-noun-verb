## Key Achievements

### Framework Validation
The 4-dimensional refinement approach proven successful in Paper 1 is now systematically applied to Papers 2-4:
1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Formal theorems and proofs
2. **Empirical Validation**: 12-15 baselines per paper
3. **Industrial Production**: Real system analysis
4. **Advanced Topics**: Specialized research directions

### Research Communities Addressed
- **Paper 1**: Systems research (OSDI/SOSP/NSDI)
- **Paper 2**: Software engineering (ICSE/FSE)
- **Paper 3**: AI/ML research (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR)
- **Paper 4**: Programming languages (PLDI/OOPSLA)

### Unified Portfolio
All 4 papers emerge from single artifact (360 templates) but address different communities, creating cross-disciplinary impact.
